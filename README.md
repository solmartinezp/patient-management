## 📁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/solmartinezp/patient-management.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder, if necessary**

   ```bash
   cd patient-management

3. **Install dependencies**

    This will install all the required packages listed in package.json.

    ```bash
    npm install

4. **Environment setup**

    Before running the application, you must configure environment variables.

    Copy the example environment file and rename it:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env

    Open the new .env file and replace placeholder values with actual configuration:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_URL="https://63bedcf7f5cfc0949b634fc8.mockapi.io/users"

    This step is required to connect the app to the patient data API.

5. **Run the Application**

    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start

6. **Open in Browser**

    Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:
